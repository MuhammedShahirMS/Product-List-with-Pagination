Product List with Pagination:
This is my Project as part of a test conducted by Riolabz, Kochi, India.

In this I created:

• A Product Page showing all 20 Products fetched from https://fakestoreapi.com/. 
• Pagination with each Page showing 6 Products maximum and thus a total of 4 pages. 
• Product detail Page for each Product upon clicking Buy button.
• Category filtering with products.
• Product search feature.
• Responsive Design across all Devices.

Project done with: React JS | Vite JS | Redux & Redux Toolkit | React Router v6 | React Bootstrap & Bootstrap | CSS Modules

More info:

• I used Vite.js instead of Create-React-App as the environment for this Project development since Vite is much faster compared to CRA.
• I used React Bootstrap with Bootstrap for Responsive design.
• This is for the mentioned test with the above mentioned feature requirements and completed within the allotted time of 1.5 days maximum.
